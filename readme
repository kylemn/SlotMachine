Hi,

To fully enjoy the slot machine to its potential(disclaimer: that potential is not much), 
make sure to hook up a speaker to your nexys3.

Hooking up speaker:
Connect the ground pin (Pin 5) of the first general
I/O port from the nexys3 to your speaker. Connect pin 1 of the first general I/O port from the nexys3
to your speaker as well.

Now you are ready to play! After uploading the bit file, you will see your money/bet amount on the
display. The first switch controls the game mode. There are two game modes: playing and betting. 
If the switch is set to 0, then you are in playing mode. If it is set to 1, you are in betting mode.
In betting mode, you can press the up or down buttons to adjust your bet amount. You can also press the
right most button to reset. In play mode, you can press the middle button which is the spin button.
This will spin the slots. The rest is self-explanatory. Thanks for trying out our thing!
